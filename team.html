				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>We started out as an individuals dream to lead a healthier lifestyle. This dream soon became a passion as our founder realized she wasn't the only one struggling to live a healthier life style. The issue however, was how do you help people commit to health when they are already so busy? The answer was simple, we created a quality line of blenders to help people reach their nutritional goals when they are short on time. With the help of our powerful blenders, people are able to whip up nutritious meals in seconds for their on the go lives.</p>
